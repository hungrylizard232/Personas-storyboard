		<h2>Interface Introduction</h2>

				<p id="interface-description" >
					The matrix treadmill uses a combination of touchscreen 
					and physical buttons to help the users personalize and monitor their workout. It consists 
					of a main screen, a phone charging station, and large buttons for speed/incline adjustment 
					and emergency stop. The main screen contains the standard run status bars, as well 
					as various applications like weather and instagram.

		<h2>Recording Observations</h2>
		<h4>General Obervations</h4>
		<div id="general-obersations" class="general-text-block">
			
			<ul>
				<li>Users start and end their workout with the same button presses, and they all seem very familiar 
					with the start and end interface. For instance, they gesture towards the bottom left corner for
					 the green start button, even though they are not currently on the start screen. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Users prefer to have some form of entertainment while working out on the treadmill, whether it 
					is only audio or audio and visual. 
				</li>
				<li>Few users connect their personal entertainment accounts (netflix, spotify) onto the treadmill, 
					because it seems more straightforward to simply use their phones.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
			<h4>Specific Questions</h4>

						<ul>
							<li style="list-style: square; font-size: smaller;">
								“[to use the spotify app on treadmill], I have to connect it to my spotify, but I already have spotify on my phone, so it seems a little silly.”

				</div>
				
				<div class="Q3">
					<p>
						<i>Can you show me how you would adjust speed or incline during your workout?</i>

					<ul class="observation-bullet">

							<b>Programming interval workouts takes too long</b>. It would be nice to have a feature that saves preprogrammed interval workouts
						</li>
						<li>
